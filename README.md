# unit9-rest-api-sql-v3
 
A REST API using Express. The API provides a way to administer a school database containing information about users and courses. Users can interact with the database to create new courses, retrieve information on existing courses, and update or delete existing courses. To make changes to the database users will be required to log in and be the 'owners' of the courses. The API also allows users to create a new account. 

For testing purposes a RESTAPI.postman_collection.json file is included to test with Postman. 

This program utilizes Node.js, Express, and Sequelize.
